My project is the website for a Louisville band called Electric Garden. The website includes the following: 
Home page (index.html) - This page has information about the band and its members.
Music Page (Music.html) - This page has information about their album and links to social media so visitors can connect with them through Facebook and listen to their first album through Spotify.
Contacts Page (Contact.html) - This page has a form for visitors to be able to contact the band for future shows. 

CSS Feature: I used flexbox to organize the content and layout when changing from smaller, medium, and large screens. 

JavaScript Feature: The form has a feature that sends a message to the visitor in case they forgot to enter their name or email. The form also logs the user information into the console log. 

Some other features: The menu changes direction according to the page size, for smaller pages the menu is vertical, for the medium and large screen the menu is horizontal. I adjusted the size and layout of the images according to the size of the screen. I linked the site with two external websites by clicking on the social media icon (music.html). I used google fonts.
