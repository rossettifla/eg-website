My project is the website for a Louisville band called Electric Garden. The website includes the following: 
Home page (index.html) - This page has information about the band and its members.
Music Page (Music.html) - This page has information about their album and links to social media so visitors can connect with them through Facebook and listen to their first album through Spotify.
Contacts Page (Contact.html) - This page has a form for visitors to be able to contact the band for future shows. 

CSS Feature: I used flexbox to organize the content and layout when changing from smaller, medium, and large screens. 

JavaScript Feature: Javascript validates the name and the email of the visitor in the contact form. The validation also checks if the visitor email is in the correct format by checking if "@" and "." was included in the field. Once the visitor submits the information correctly, the form sends a Thank you message to the visitor using their name. 

Some other features: The menu changes direction according to the page size, for smaller pages the menu is vertical, for the medium and large screen the menu is horizontal. I adjusted the size and layout of the images according to the size of the screen. I linked the site with two external websites by clicking on the social media icon (music.html). I used google fonts.
